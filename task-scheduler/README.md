## Description

The Task Scheduler is a Python script designed to automate and schedule repetitive tasks such as backups, file transfers, or data synchronization between different devices or cloud services.

## Best Use Case

- Automating daily backups of important files.
- Scheduling regular transfers of files between devices.
- Syncing data between local storage and cloud services on a recurring basis.

## Installation

### Installing Python

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation Steps on

#### Windows

- Download the Python installer for Windows from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Python.
- Make sure to check the option to add Python to PATH during installation.

#### MacOSX

- MacOSX usually comes with Python pre-installed. Open the Terminal and type `python --version` to check if Python is installed.
- If Python is not installed, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Linux

- Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check if Python is installed by opening a terminal and typing `python --version`.
- If Python is not installed, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use `sudo apt-get install python3`.

### Installing Dependencies

The Task Scheduler script requires the `schedule` and `colorama` modules. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install schedule colorama
```
