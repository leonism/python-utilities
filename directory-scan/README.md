## Description

![screenshot](directory-scanner.png)
The Inventory Generator Script is a Python utility designed to generate an inventory of files in a specified folder and save it to a text file. üìÅ It allows users to quickly and easily catalog the contents of a directory, making it useful for organization, documentation, and analysis purposes. üöÄ

## Best Use Case

The script is particularly handy in scenarios where you need to keep track of numerous files within a directory, such as:

- **Maintaining Project Assets**: Easily catalog image, video, or document assets in a project folder.
- **Documentation**: Generate a list of files for documentation purposes, ensuring all files are accounted for.
- **File Cleanup**: Identify redundant or unnecessary files for cleanup or archiving.

## Installation

### Checking Python Version

Before installing and using the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. To check your Python version, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

### Installing Dependencies

The script does not require any external dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leonism/python-utilities.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change to the directory containing the script:

   ```bash
   cd directory-scan
   ```

## Usage

To use the Inventory Generator Script:

1. **Configure Variables**: Open the script file (`directory-scan.py`) in a text editor and modify the variables as needed. Specify the folder path to scan (`folder_to_scan`), the output file path (`output_file_path`), and any exclusion patterns (`exclude_patterns`).

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python inventory_generator.py
   ```

3. **View Inventory**: Once the script completes execution, the inventory will be saved to the specified output file.

## Example

Suppose you have a project folder containing various image assets (`/project/assets/images/`). You can use the Inventory Generator Script to generate an inventory of these images for documentation or reference purposes.
