# 📋 Clipboard Manager Utility Script

Welcome to the Clipboard Manager utility script! 🎉 This Python script helps you keep track of everything you've copied, making it easy to access your clipboard history whenever you need it.

## 🚀 Features

- **Clipboard Monitoring**: Automatically captures changes to your clipboard in real-time.
- **History Management**: Stores all your copied content so you can refer back to it later.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find specific entries in your clipboard history.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: If you're not sure if Python is installed, don't worry! We'll show you how to check and install it.
- **pyperclip library**: This library is used to interact with the clipboard. If you don't have it, we'll guide you through installing it.

## 🔍 Checking Python Version

Let's first check if Python is installed on your computer and what version you have. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

If you see a version number starting with `3.x`, you're good to go! If not, don't panic! We'll show you how to install Python next.

## 📦 Checking and Installing Dependencies

Now, let's make sure you have the `pyperclip` library installed. Run the following command:

```bash
pip show pyperclip
```

If you get an error or don't see any information about `pyperclip`, it means you need to install it. Don't worry; we'll help you with that too!

## 🛠️ Installing Python

If you don't have Python installed, no problem! Python is free and easy to install. Just follow these steps:

1. **Download Python**: Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.
2. **Install Python**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
3. **Verify Installation**: After installation, open a new terminal or command prompt window and run `python --version` again to verify that Python is installed correctly.

## 📦 Installing Dependencies

If you need to install the `pyperclip` library, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyperclip
```

Now that we have everything set up, let's get to the fun part - using the Clipboard Manager utility script!
