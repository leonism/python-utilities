## Best Use Case

The script is particularly handy in scenarios where you need to keep track of numerous files within a directory, such as:

- **Maintaining Project Assets**: Easily catalog image, video, or document assets in a project folder.
- **Documentation**: Generate a list of files for documentation purposes, ensuring all files are accounted for.
- **File Cleanup**: Identify redundant or unnecessary files for cleanup or archiving.

## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: If you're not sure if Python is installed, don't worry! We'll show you how to check and install it.
- **pip**: This is a package manager for Python. We'll guide you through installing it if needed.

### Checking Python Version

Let's first check if Python is installed on your computer and what version you have. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

If you see a version number starting with `3.x`, you're good to go! If not, follow the instructions below to install Python for your operating system.

#### Installing Python (Windows)

1. **Download Python**: Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.
2. **Run Installer**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
3. **Verify Installation**: After installation, open a new Command Prompt window and run `python --version` again to verify that Python is installed correctly.

#### Installing Python (macOS)

1. **Installation via Homebrew (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```

#### Installing Python (Linux)

1. **Installation via apt (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3
   ```

### Installing pip

If you don't already have pip installed, follow these instructions to install it:

#### Installing pip (Windows)

1. **Download get-pip.py**: Download the [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) script.
2. **Run Script**: Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory containing `get-pip.py`, then run:
   ```bash
   python get-pip.py
   ```

#### Installing pip (macOS & Linux)

Pip usually comes pre-installed with Python on macOS and most Linux distributions. To ensure pip is up to date, run:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

If the previous command line threw you an error, you might want to try to the following command instead :

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Installing Dependencies

Now that we have Python and pip set up, let's install the `pyperclip` library:

```bash
pip install pyperclip
```

If the previous command line threw you an error, you might want to try to the following command instead :

```bash
python3 -m pip install pyperclip
```

Now you're all set to use the Clipboard Manager utility script!
